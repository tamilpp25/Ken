# Ken - Perception using AI
A simple device that can combine data from multiple sensors and give a brief description of its local environment. It harnesses the power of AI and the idea of non-binary decision making.

# Getting Started:
1. Install the dependencies required using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Upload arduino code from `Hardware/ken.ino` make sure the serial port is same in `__main__.py` when connected
3. Run the project using `python -m ken`

# Components Used
1. Arduino Uno
2. DHT11 Sensor
3. LDR Sensor
4. Sound Sensor
5. Ultrasonic Sensor
6. Breadboard and jumper wires

### Disclaimer 
This is merely a prototype and was designed to function in a simplified manner, adhering to the hardware limitations specified by the 'Wired-In' hackathon.
