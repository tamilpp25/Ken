1. Install the dependencies required using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Upload arduino code from `Hardware/ken.ino` make sure the serial port is same in `__main__.py` when connected
3. Run the project using `python -m ken`

### Disclaimer 
This is merely a prototype and was designed to function in a simplified manner, adhering to the hardware limitations specified by the 'Wired-In' hackathon.
